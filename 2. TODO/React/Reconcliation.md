> React reconciliation is the process through which React updates the user interface to match the most recent application state. When your application's state changes, React needs to figure out how the UI should change to reflect that new state.

* React Reconcliation包含幾個方面
	* Vitual DOM Diffing
	* Reconcliation Algorithm (stack reconcliation / fiber reconcliation)
	* Component Lifecycle Methods
	* Keys
	* Batched Updates

## Stack Reconcliation
* LIFO
* 如果任務有優先順序/任務需要中斷,在Stack結構會較困難實現
## [[Fiber Reconcliation]]
